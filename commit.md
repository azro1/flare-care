# Medications Page Responsive Improvements

- Fixed responsive container padding to match other pages (prevents nav/footer overflow on small screens)
- Implemented stacking layout at 320px: medication name and buttons stack vertically, name wraps fully
- At 640px+: returns to horizontal layout with truncated names
- Installed react-masonry-css library and implemented 2-column masonry layout on large screens - items stay in position when others expand
- Fixed notes text wrapping to prevent overflow
