            <p>
              Hi, I'm Simon, and I was diagnosed with Crohn's disease in 2005. Like many others, 
              I quickly learned that managing this condition requires constant attention 
              to symptoms, medications, and lifestyle factors.
            </p>
            <p>
              As an outpatient at the Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel, I've experienced 
              firsthand the challenges of tracking symptoms, remembering medication schedules, 
              and communicating effectively with my healthcare team.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over the years, I've tried various methods to keep track of my health data - 
              from simple notebooks to complex apps that didn't quite fit my needs. 
              That's when I realized there was a gap in the market for a tool designed 
              specifically for Crohn's and Colitis patients.

          <div className="space-y-4 text-gray-700">
            <p>
              FlareCare was born from my personal need for a simple, effective way to 
              track my health journey. I wanted something that would:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4">
              <li>Make symptom logging quick and intuitive</li>
              <li>Help identify patterns and triggers</li>
              <li>Generate clear reports for medical appointments</li>
              <li>Work seamlessly across devices</li>
              <li>Respect privacy with local-first data storage</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The app is designed to grow with you - whether you're newly diagnosed 
              or have been managing your condition for years.
